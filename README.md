# dndme

Tools for helping me run Dungeons & Dragons sessions.

Features include:

* dice rolling
* initiative & turn order management
* encounter management

Data about the party, individual monsters, and encounters
is defined in TOML files which can be loaded via the shell.
Sample data for a party and single encounter is included.

Code can be interacted with directly via your favorite Python REPL
(I have used Jupyter Notebook for tracking turn order in live sessions)
or with a basic shell that features an extensible command set.

Here's an example of rudimentary turn management in a Python shell.
For each turn, the TurnManager emits a tuple of the round number,
rolled initiative value, and the object whose turn it is.
Note that the TurnManager doesn't care what objects you put into it
as combatants, so it can be as simple as just a plain string.

```
    >>> from initiative import TurnManager
    >>> from dice import roll_dice, roll_dice_expr
    >>> tm = TurnManager()
    >>> # Add monster initiatives
    >>> tm.add_combatant('goblin1', 12)
    >>> # Add party initiatives
    >>> tm.add_combatant('Sariel', 21)
    >>> turns = tm.generate_turns()
    >>> next(turns)
    (1, 21, 'Sariel')
    >>> next(turns)
    (1, 12, 'Goblin')
    >>> next(turns)
    (2, 21, 'Sariel')
```

Here's an example of playing with the shell,
where characters and monsters are proper, rich objects
with lots of interesting data:

Everything here is "first draft" code as I explore the problem space.
Contributions are welcome.

Everything we add should aim to be simple to use, with a close second goal of
being simple to implement. If the implementation is really tricky, or is a
struggle, that's a sign that we might be trying to be too clever or take too
much of the judgment away from the DM. We are not attempting to model the
entire ruleset or automate the game, just make the DM's life a little easier.
